### Summary:

Its obvious there is huge contribution in revenue by the Urban market as compared to Rural and Suburban.



1. Urban Market:
since Urban market is generating more revenue, and people are using more ride service in this area.
Fare should be slightly increased. This suggestion is based on total number of rides which are 1625.
Little increase would not discourge the rider to take the service, in fact company's overall revenue will increase.

2. Suburban Market:
This market has fairly less contribution in revenues to the business. Its needed to push total number of rides.
This can happen only if ride is cheaper which can encourge people to use the service. When there is increase in 
total rides but reducing the fares, more drivers should be hired.

3. Rural Market:
Rural market is the least performing to the business's revenues. Average fare per ride is the highest and
total number of drivers are the lowest among other markets.Both are negative points to encourge consumer to use the service. 
The stratergy for this market should be increase total number of drivers and reduce significant fare rates.
This will attract consumer and it will hook them to use service. Since distnaces are more in this area, 
service should be quick and cheaper.
